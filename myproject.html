        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>As I explore several different interests that may lead my down new paths, I yearn to combine
            my love for creativity with my technical-orietned skill set. Through my work, I hope you are able to 
            see the beginnings and development of some of my creations.

            <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
            <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
            <p>Our goal for this project was to observe users interact with some sort interface, interview 
                their experience with it, record their observations, and illustrate a storyboard for one a 
                personas we studied. We sought to identify flaws in such interfaces</p>
            <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
            <p>I found that it was often the case that students were able to successful navigate the interface.
                However, there were definately a handful of people who found it frustrating to get help when the
                interface wasn't working the way they wanted it to.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
            <p>Overall, the project demonstrated that tht interface was effective at it's job. I was able to understand
                the "why" behind designing interfaces, as I studied the intricate components of such interface that is
                used on a daily basis. It gave me a more holistic point of view on interactive design in technology.

            <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
            <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
            <p>Our goal for this project was to find a website that could use some updates on the design and 
                accessibility. I was able to identify a local company that I worked for and redesign their 
                website in a non-iteractive manner.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Design Iterations</u></h5>
            <p>My design decisions focused on the simplicity of the website. The original website was a bit
                confusing to use and it was unclear as to how to go about navigating it. Thus, my design
                focused on making sure that the website accessibility was nice and neat.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
            <p>I found that this project had an very large audience, in that people using this website consisted
                of many different ages. Ultimately, I was able to get positive feedback, in that my design was
                clear and simple. However, the details of the website can use some work.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
            <p>This project allowed me to actively redesign the shell of a website while utilizing design considerations
                that we studied in class. It gave me a greater appreciation and understanding of what exactly goes
                into web design and development.

            <h1>Figma Startup Design</h1>
            <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
            <p>Our goal for this project was to find a startup that to design a website for them without looking at
                their actual website they created. In doing so, we were trying to best implement and display the 
                goals of the company. We were able to choose a company called Airhart Aeronautics.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Design Iterations</u></h5>
            <p>My design decisions focused on properly displaying what it is that the company was trying to do 
                in their business model. Thus, we tried to be as specific and clear as possible, giving the user
                a ton of information on how the could get involved and what exactly they would get when interacting
                with said company.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
            <p>I found that this project was very futuristic, in that the startup that we were focusing on had a concept
                that had yet to be fully developed. Thus, it was a bit hard for us to properly implement everything they 
                were trying to display. However, we recieved good feedback on how to update our website mock-up so that 
                it made navigational sense to the user.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
            <p>This project allowed me to actively design a mock website only using a simple business model. We had not looked
                at the company website to design it beforehand, thus it was a very realistic design process—we took an idea
                and built it into an interactive model.

            <h1>Website Development</h1>
            <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
            <p>Our goal for this project was to create a website of our choice, incorporating basic functionality
                of an online store. We sought to keep in mind acccessibility design while also making sure to
                create an aesthetic page. 
            </p>
            <h5><u>Design Iterations</u></h5>
            <p>My design decisions were centered around the idea of a very basic hat shop, in which the images had
                clear presentation while also including important details regarding each product (price, style, material, etc.).
                I thought it best to create a sidebar for filtering a search of the product, and also included responsive
                buttons to let the customer know when their product is added to cart. Overall, I tried to mimic an online
                retail shop as best I could. 
            </p>
            <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
            <p>I found that this project was very helpful in getting to develop my skills in Javascript, HTML, and css 
                all in one. The feedback I received was overall positive, and it helped me take into consideration things
                to improve on next time. I think that my biggest takeaway is to create a shop that includes everything
                a consumer would want to have on it, including the minor details that some may take for granted.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
            <p>This project allowed me to create a working website where I was able to learn about Javascript and React
                more intricately. It expanded my horizons as to what I can do as a web developer and the potential I hold
                to create even more complex and interactive websites in the future. I really was able to gain confidence
                in my programming skills while also getting to do something that feels both practical and fulfilling.
